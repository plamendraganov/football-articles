Always a practical man, Houlding quickly decided to circumvent this problem by forming his own club â€“ Liverpool. After becoming a member of the Football League in 1893, the team managed to get promoted to first division after one season in the second division. Early on, Liverpool established themselves as one of England's top clubs, winning League titles in 1901, 1906, 1922 and 1923.`, 'John Doe', '../../../assets/liverpool.jpg');
